# Progetto-SDCC
Use the sh files in bash utils folder to install and run a demo of the project.
In order to analyze deeper the functionalities of every single node, use the dockerfile in the node inspector folder.
That dockerfile will produce an image able to be used as every node, with some utilities installed on the container.

For any further information about the project, please consult the report.
